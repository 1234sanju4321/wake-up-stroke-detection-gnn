# Early Stroke Detection Using AI

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for an **AI-based early stroke detection system** using physiological and hemodynamic signals. The system predicts stroke risk scores and classifies cases as low, medium or high risk.

## 📦 Project Structure
- `data/`: Dataset storage (raw + processed)
- `notebooks/`: EDA, preprocessing, and model training notebooks
- `src/`: Python scripts for model development
- `models/`: Saved model checkpoints
- `results/`: Evaluation results and figures

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data preprocessing** – Clean raw signals and extract features
2. **Model training** – Train using Graph Neural Network (GNN) or chosen ML model
3. **Evaluation** – Assess model performance
4. **Prediction** – Run real-time stroke risk prediction

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Results
Performance metrics and plots are stored in the `results/` folder.
